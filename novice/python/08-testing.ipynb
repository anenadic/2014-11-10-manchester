      "## What is testing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Software testing is exercising and confirming expected behaviours and results from code. It allows us to check that,\n",
      "\n",
      "* Our code behaves as expected and produces valid output data given valid input data.\n",
      "* Our code does this using *any* set of valid input data.\n",
      "* Our code fails gracefully if given invalid input data - it does not just crash or behave mysteriously or unpredictably but, for example, exits politely with a message as to why the input data is invalid.\n",
      "* Our code can handle extreme boundaries of input domains, output ranges, parametric combinations or any other edge cases.\n",
      "* Our code's existing behaviour is still the same after we've changed it (this is called *regression testing*).\n",
      "\n",
      "It also gives us the confidence to:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Add new features.\n",
      "* Optimise our code.\n",
      "* Parallelise our code.\n",
      "* Fix bugs.\n",
      "\n",
      "...all without introducing bugs. Nothing is worse than fixing a bug only to introduce a new one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tests also help us remember what all the parts of our code does. If we are working on a large project over three years and end up with 100s of functions, it may be hard to remember what each function does in detail. If we have a test that checks all of the function's functionality, we can look at the test to remember what it's supposed to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Why we should do testing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Testing allows us, and others, to trust our code and trust it enough to answer in the affirmative to at least a few of the following questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Does your code work?\n",
      "* Always?\n",
      "* Does it do what we think it does?\n",
      "* Does it continue to work after changes are made, for example optimisations or bug fixes?\n",
      "* Does it continue to work after system configurations or libraries are upgraded?\n",
      "* Does it respond properly for a full range of input parameters?\n",
      "* Does it handle about edge or corner cases?\n",
      "\n",
      "As a cautionary tale, consider Ariane 5 which used Ariane 4 software. Ariane 5 had new and improved engines which caused the code to produce a buffer overflow...and Ariane 5 blew up! So, some forgotten tests led to millions of pounds down the drain and some very red faces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or, consider [Geoffrey Chang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Chang) who had to [retract](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/314/5807/1875.2.long) 3 papers from [Science](http://www.sciencemag.org), due to a flipped sign! Or, McKitrick and Michaels' [Climate Research 26(2) 2004](http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/cr/v26/n2/p159-173/) paper, which drew the attention of a blogger Tim Lambert who noted a [problem](http://crookedtimber.org/2004/08/25/mckitrick-mucks-it-up/) which led to their subsequent [erratum](http://www.int-res.com/articles/cr2004/27/c027p265.pdf).\n",
      "\n",
      "Do this too regularly and people may not trust our research, which could affect our chances for collaborations, publications or funding.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if this is not compelling, then, if nothing else, writing tests is an investment in time that saves us time in future,\n",
      "\n",
      "* We can automate the checking of outputs from our software to ensure they're valid.\n",
      "* We can detect more quickly whether refactoring, optimisation or parallelisation has introduced bugs.\n",
      "* We can run our tests while doing other, more interesting, things."
